        <img src="me.jpg" alt="picture of lewis">
        <p>Here is some information about me. I was born in NY,
            and moved to TX when I was 8. I ended up moving back
            home when I was 15. I joined the Navy after dropping
            out of high school. After the Navy I served a mission 
            and then moved to Provo where I attended BYU and recieved 
            a BFA from BYU.
        </p>
